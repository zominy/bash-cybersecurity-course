# 🔡🕵️ Module 7: Regex and Parsing: Extracting Intelligence from Chaos 🟧

The documents in this folder are here to accompany the Module 7 content.

In this module, you’ll use Bash with tools like `grep`, `awk`, `cut`, and `sed` to dig through log files and spot useful info like IPs and failed login attempts. You’ll get hands-on with regex and build a simple script to pull out key details for basic log analysis.
