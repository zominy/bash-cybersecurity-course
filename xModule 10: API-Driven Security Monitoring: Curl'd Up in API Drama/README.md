# 🔑🗂️ Module 10: API-Driven Security Monitoring 🟥

The documents in this folder are here to accompany the Module 10 content.

We dive into automating threat intelligence with Bash scripting and public APIs like AbuseIPDB.

In the video, you’ll walk through building a Bash script that:

- Accepts an IP address as input
- Sends it to AbuseIPDB via `curl`
- Parses the response with `jq`
- Outputs a colour-coded risk score for quick triage
