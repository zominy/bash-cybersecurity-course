### Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

Due to the content of this module, you will be required to install a new service. Again, I would like to advise that if you are following along you use the same distro as me as covered in [Module 1](https://github.com/zominy/bash-cybersecurity-course/blob/main/Module%201%3A%20Intro%20to%20Bash%20-%20The%20Cybersecurity%20Shell/notes.md) (look at the setup section).

Please run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y
```
- Updates the package list and upgrades all installed packages to the latest versions available from the updated list.

```bash
sudo apt install -y cron
```
- This command installs the `cron` package
