| Starting the cron service    | Nothing happens when you try to start it          | It might already be running or the command was wrong       | Use `sudo systemctl status cron` to check if it‚Äôs already running                |
| Script not running at all    | You don‚Äôt get the disk report file as expected    | Cron couldn‚Äôt run your script or save the output           | Use full paths in the script, make it executable with `chmod +x`                |
| Using `$USER` in the script  | The output file never shows up                    | Cron doesn‚Äôt know what `$USER` means                       | Replace `$USER` with your actual username or use full paths                      |
| Editing with `crontab -e`    | Stuck in vim or can‚Äôt type                        | Vim opens in normal mode (and it‚Äôs confusing at first)     | Press `i` to start typing, then `Esc`, `:wq` to save and exit                    |
| Crontab job never triggers   | It never runs at 8am like you expect              | Wrong path to script or it‚Äôs not marked as executable      | Double check the script path and run `chmod +x script.sh`                        |
| Script works in terminal but not in cron | Nothing happens when cron runs it           | Your environment in cron is different                      | Use full paths (like `/usr/bin/df` as mentioned in commands.md) and don‚Äôt rely on environment variables      |
| Crontab seems empty          | `no crontab for user` message                     | You haven‚Äôt saved anything in `crontab -e` yet             | Open `crontab -e`, add your line, and save properly                              |
