|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Running `mkdir lab/module2/test`                    | Says no such file or directory                                 | The parent folders don‚Äôt exist yet                                            | Use `mkdir -p lab/module2/test` to create the full path in one go                     |
| Using `cd lab/module2/test/../../module2`           | Ends up confusing or in the wrong place                        | It‚Äôs a tricky path to follow in your head                                     | Navigate step-by-step or use `tree lab` to see what‚Äôs going on                        |
| Typing `tree`                                       | `command not found`                                            | `tree` isn‚Äôt installed by default                                             | Install it with `sudo apt install tree`                                               |
| Running `tree` with no options                      | It dumps loads of info                                         | Shows everything, even deep folders                                           | Use `tree -L 1` to keep it simple                                                     |
| Seeing `chmod 700`, `400`, etc.                     | Not sure what the numbers mean                                 | The number codes for read/write/execute can be confusing                      | Remember: `r=4`, `w=2`, `x=1` ‚Äì add them up for each group                           |
| Doing `chmod 100 newfile.txt`                      | Can‚Äôt read or write the file anymore                           | You gave it only execute permissions                                          | Use `chmod 600` for read/write, `chmod 700` to include execute too                    |
| Running `touch` but get `Permission denied`         | File isn‚Äôt created                                             | You‚Äôre trying to create a file somewhere you don‚Äôt have access                | Work in your home directory or use `sudo` if you must                                 |
| Doing `sudo chown $USER:$USER newfile.txt`          | Doesn‚Äôt work as expected                                       | `$USER` doesn‚Äôt expand properly in some shells                                | Use your actual username: `sudo chown max:max newfile.txt`                            |
| Running `find /etc -name "*log*conf"`               | Lots of `Permission denied` errors                             | Some folders in `/etc` are restricted                                         | Use `sudo` with the command: `sudo find /etc -name "*log*conf"`                      |
| Typing `find /etc -name *.conf` (no quotes)         | Doesn‚Äôt work right or gives unexpected results                 | Shell expands the `*` before `find` sees it                                   | Put wildcards in quotes: `find /etc -name "*.conf"`                                  |
| Mixing up `cd /` and `cd ..`                        | Ends up in the wrong folder                                    | They do very different things                                                 | `cd /` goes to the root. `cd ..` goes up one folder                                   |
| Created a file with `touch` but can‚Äôt find it       | File‚Äôs gone missing                                            | You were in a different folder than you thought                              | Use `pwd` to see where you are, or `find . -name newfile.txt` to track it down        |
| Thinking `chmod` changes everything inside a folder | Only changes the folder itself                                 | It‚Äôs not recursive unless you tell it to be                                  | Add `-R` to make it recursive: `chmod -R 700 myfolder/`                              |
| Running `chown` without `sudo`                      | Command fails                                                  | Only root can change file ownership                                           | Use `sudo chown $USER:$USER newfile.txt`                                              |
