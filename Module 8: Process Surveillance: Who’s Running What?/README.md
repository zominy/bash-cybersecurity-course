# 🕵️‍♂️⚙️ Module 8: Process Surveillance: Who's Running What? 🟥

The documents in this folder are here to accompany the Module 8 content.

This lab introduces basic process surveillance techniques on Linux systems. We will use command-line tools to monitor running processes in real-time, detect suspicious activities (like unauthorised nc listeners), and log new processes as they appear. It emphasises practical skills for early threat detection and system monitoring.
