# ðŸ“‹ðŸ’Ž Module 11: Offensive Bash: Writing a Simple Recon Script ðŸŸ©

The documents in this folder accompany the Module 11 content.

In this module, we build a **basic local recon script** using Bash which is designed to gather key system information quickly and efficiently.

While the script is fundamental by design, it sets a solid foundation for future expansion into more advanced enumeration, auditing, or post-exploitation workflows.

In the video, youâ€™ll walk through building a Bash script that:

- Prints system details (hostname, OS, kernel, uptime)
- Lists users, recent logins, and active services
- Grabs network configuration and open ports
- Finds potentially interesting files (`.conf`, `.log`, `.bak`)

- Opened a terminal and are ready to start

ðŸ•’ **Estimated Effort:** ~20â€“25 minutes

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aims

- Practice using essential Linux recon commands
- Write clean, readable, and modular Bash scripts
- Automate basic enumeration tasks
- Create a base tool you can build on for deeper recon and analysis

## ðŸ“š Material for Module 11

1. [ðŸ“– Commands](./commands.md)  
   A breakdown of every section of the script with explanations.  
   Use this as a reference or starting point for expanding your own recon tools.

2. [âš  Possible errors and how to fix them](./errors.md)  
   A list of common mistakes (like missing tools or permission errors) and how to resolve them.
