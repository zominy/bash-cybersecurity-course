# 📋💎 Module 11: Offensive Bash: Writing a Simple Recon Script 🟩

The documents in this folder accompany the Module 11 content.

In this module, we build a **basic local recon script** using Bash which is designed to gather key system information quickly and efficiently.

While the script is fundamental by design, it sets a solid foundation for future expansion into more advanced enumeration, auditing, or post-exploitation workflows.

In the video, you’ll walk through building a Bash script that:

- Prints system details (hostname, OS, kernel, uptime)
- Lists users, recent logins, and active services
- Grabs network configuration and open ports
- Finds potentially interesting files (`.conf`, `.log`, `.bak`)

## 🧭 Before You Start

Make sure you’ve:
- Read the [Getting Started guide](../GETTING_STARTED.md)
- Booted into a **Debian-based** Linux distro (e.g. Kali Linux or Ubuntu)
- Opened a terminal and are ready to start

🕒 **Estimated Effort:** ~20–25 minutes

---

## 🎯 Aims

- Practice using essential Linux recon commands
- Write clean, readable, and modular Bash scripts
- Automate basic enumeration tasks
- Create a base tool you can build on for deeper recon and analysis

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Build basic recon scripts for ethical hacking and CTFs  
- Gather system and network information programmatically

## 📚 Material for Module 11

1. [📖 Commands](./commands.md)  
   A breakdown of every section of the script with explanations.  
   Use this as a reference or starting point for expanding your own recon tools.

2. [⚠ Possible errors and how to fix them](./errors.md)  
   A list of common mistakes (like missing tools or permission errors) and how to resolve them.
