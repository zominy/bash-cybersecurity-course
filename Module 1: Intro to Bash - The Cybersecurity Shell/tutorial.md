## Introduction

In this tutorial, I cover the basics of Bash scripting and command line usage from the module 1 video. You can use this to read up on the material or go through the labs in your own time.

### üéØ Aims
### By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Use simple commands such as ls, pwd, echo, nano, and cd with knowledge of how they work.

To be able to string commands together.

To have knowledge of shortcuts and what they do.

### Note: Please check out the [command file](commands.md) for help if you are struggling to understand any concepts.

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏èüîß

The setup for this lab is minimal. Download a virtual machine software. For this course, I used VMware; I just prefer it, but whichever software you use does not really matter.

If you are unable to get VMware, I recommend Virtual Box instead. Both are great virtual machine softwares:

### Installation Resources For Virtualisation Software

- [VirtualBox Official Site](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [VMware Official Site](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html)

In addition to this, here is guides on how to install the OS that I will be using for this course (Debian):
