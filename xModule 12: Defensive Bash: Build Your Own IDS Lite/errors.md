| Running the script                          | `mkdir: cannot create directory ... Permission denied`         | You didn‚Äôt use `sudo` to run script, or the directory‚Äôs locked down                            | Run it with `sudo`, or pick a folder you‚Äôve actually got permission for     |
| Running the script                          | `mail: command not found`                                      | Your system doesn‚Äôt have the `mail` command                                      | Install it with `sudo apt install mailutils` (or the right package for your distro) |
| Running the script                          | `curl: command not found`                                      | Curl isn‚Äôt installed                                                              | Just run `sudo apt install curl` (or whatever works on your system)         |
| Running the script                          | `journalctl: command not found`                                | Your system doesn‚Äôt use `systemd`, or it‚Äôs not available                          | Needs `systemd`: check if it‚Äôs supported or try another method             |
| Logs not saving or script crashes early     | `tee: /usr/local/var/...: No such file or directory`           | Those output folders weren‚Äôt made yet                                             | Make sure `mkdir -p` runs properly, especially with `sudo`                  |
| Script running but temp files failing       | `No such file or directory` from `/tmp/ids_temp_journal/$ip`   | Temp folder wasn‚Äôt created                                                        | Add `mkdir -p "$TMP_DIR"` near the top of your script                       |
| Not getting any alerts                      | Script runs, but no alerts show up                             | SSH log entries aren‚Äôt being picked up, perhaps maybe wrong service or timing            | Double-check with `journalctl -u ssh.service` to see if it‚Äôs logging fails  |
| Script throws permission errors             | Can‚Äôt write to logs or reports                                 | Missing `sudo`, or the file permissions aren‚Äôt set right                          | Use `chmod` as in the script, and run with `sudo`                           |
| Making changes but nothing happens          | It keeps using the old version                                 | Might not be executable, or you‚Äôre not running the updated file                   | Use `bash script.sh`, or `chmod +x` then `./script.sh`                      |
| Slack alerts not showing up                 | No messages appear in Slack                                    | Your webhook URL‚Äôs broken or expired                                              | Get a fresh webhook from Slack and update `WEBHOOK_URL`                     |
| Weird file names in the reports folder      | Filenames have colons or look broken                           | Timestamps with colons (`:`) mess with some file systems                          | The script should fix that already but if not, replace `:` with `-` manually  |
| System starts lagging a bit                 | High CPU or loads of log spam                                  | That `while true; sleep 1` loop runs constantly and prints every log line         | Try slowing it down, or use something like `inotify` or a log monitoring tool |
