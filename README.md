# üõ°Ô∏è Bash for Cybersecurity: YouTube Course Companion

Welcome! This is the official GitHub companion for my YouTube course on **Bash scripting for cybersecurity** - designed for aspiring security professionals, sysadmins, and ethical hackers.

---

## üéØ Course Aim

To provide hands-on Bash scripting skills tailored to cybersecurity tasks - from navigation to log monitoring, scripting, parsing, and basic recon/defense automation.

---

## üì¢ Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Navigate and manage Linux systems using terminal commands
- Understand and modify file permissions, ownership and structure
- Write Bash scripts with variables, conditionals, loops and functions
- Use Bash alongside common security tools (e.g. `nmap`, `whois`, `ping`)
- Monitor and analyse logs using `grep`, `journalctl`, `awk`, and similar tools
- Detect failed logins and suspicious activity with custom scripts
- Use regular expressions to extract meaningful data from logs
- Schedule recurring tasks using `cron` for automation
- Retrieve threat intelligence from APIs and process JSON with `jq`
- Create simple offensive scripts for ethical hacking and CTFs
- Develop basic defensive scripts such as a lightweight IDS

## üß∞ Before You Start

If you're already comfortable using a terminal on a Debian-based Linux system, skip ahead.

Otherwise if you're new to Linux or don't know how to set up your environment yet:

üëâ **Start here:** [Beginner Setup Guide](./GETTING_STARTED.md)

That guide will walk you through:
- Installing a Linux system (Kali, Ubuntu, etc.)
- Setting up a virtual machine (if needed)
- Using the terminal and basic commands

You‚Äôll only need to do this once. After that, you can jump into any module.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use This Course

1. **Pick a module below**
2. **Watch the video**
3. **Read `commands.md` for key commands and concepts and for help**
4. **Refer to `errors.md` if anything breaks**

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time Per Module

Most modules take **30‚Äì60 minutes** to complete. You can work at your own pace.

---

## üìò Course Modules

Each module has:
- `commands.md` ‚Äì all commands with explanations
- `errors.md` ‚Äì common mistakes and how to fix them
- *(Legacy)* `notes.md` ‚Äì used before Module 5, now merged into `commands.md`
