üé• Watch the series: [Watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QyjFj5dRVE&list=PLGPhFvIx6g8hdTP3fj2GV7qeISOUjYknL)

üìÇ This repo contains all the scripts, commands, and error fixes used in each episode.

## üìò Course Modules

Each module has:
- `commands.md` ‚Äì all commands used, with explanations as to what they do.
- `errors.md` ‚Äì common mistakes or errors to watch out for!
- *(Legacy)* `notes.md` ‚Äì Earlier modules contain `notes.md` (formerly `tutorial.md`) files, which were deprecated after Module 4 due to redundancy with `commands.md`. From Module 5 onward, all technical explanations are contained directly in `commands.md`, making the project more concise and efficient.
