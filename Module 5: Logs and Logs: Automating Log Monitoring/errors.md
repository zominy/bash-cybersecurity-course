|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Running `journalctl`          | `sudo: journalctl: command not found`                      | You're probably not on a systemd-based distro                        | Make sure you‚Äôre using something like Debian, Ubuntu, or another systemd-based OS        |
| Viewing logs with `-n`        | Shows hardly anything or just a few lines                  | The system hasn‚Äôt generated that many logs yet                       | Try a smaller number like `-n 10` or do some activity to generate logs                   |
| Using `journalctl -f`         | Seems to just sit there doing nothing                      | No new logs are being written                                        | Open another terminal and do something to trigger activity like in the video.        |
| Filtering with `grep`         | Nothing shows up                                           | No failed logins have happened yet                                   | Try running a few fake SSH login attempts or scan older logs                            |
| Redirecting to file           | `Permission denied`                                        | Trying to write somewhere you don‚Äôt have access                      | Use `sudo` or redirect to somewhere in your home folder                                  |
| Using `cat`                   | `No such file or directory`                                | You haven‚Äôt created the file yet (or mistyped the name)              | Check spelling or re-run the command that was meant to generate the file                |
| Using `less`                  | `less: command not found`                                  | It‚Äôs not installed on bare-bones systems                             | Install it with your package manager (`sudo apt install less`)                    |
| Using `vi`                   | Can‚Äôt exit or feels stuck                                  | `vi` can be a bit fiddly if you‚Äôre not used to it                    | Use the cheat sheet: `i` to insert, `Esc`, then `:wq` to save and quit                   |
| Running the script            | `Permission denied` when trying to run it                  | The script isn‚Äôt marked as executable                                | Run `chmod +x script.sh` first                                                           |
| Script runs, but no output    | Says 0 failed logins, or file is empty                     | Nothing matched or system is too new/clean                           | Try again after some time or broaden the search (e.g. remove quotes from grep)          |
| Making a folder in script     | `mkdir: cannot create directory`                           | `$HOME` is unset or something‚Äôs off with the path                    | Use a full path like `/home/<yourname>/log_scans` instead                                  |
