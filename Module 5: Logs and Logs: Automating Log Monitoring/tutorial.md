# Module 5: Logs and Logs: Automating Log Monitoring 🔍🤖

## Introduction

In this tutorial, I will be covering the Module 5 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYclAh6ZAX4&list=PLGPhFvIx6g8hdTP3fj2GV7qeISOUjYknL). In this video we cover logs, and how to automate log monitoring. Some new commands are covered, and we develop a new script.

## Aims 🎯
- Understand where and how system logs are stored.
- Use tools like `grep`, `tail`, and `journalctl` to read logs.
- Identify failed login attempts in logs.
- Write a basic bash script to automate log scanning.
