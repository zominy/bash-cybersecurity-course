|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Installing the tools          | `sudo: apt: command not found`                           | You're not using a Debian-based distro like Ubuntu                    | Use the right package manager for your system (like `dnf`, `yum`, or `apk`)             |
| Installing the tools          | `E: Unable to locate package nmap`                       | Your package list is out of date                                       | Run `sudo apt update` before installing                                                  |
| Running `nmap`                | `command not found`                                      | `nmap` wasn‚Äôt successfully installed                                   | Try `sudo apt install nmap` again and make sure it completes                            |
| Grepping scan output          | No output from `grep "closed"`                           | All scanned ports are open or filtered                                | Try grepping for "open" instead, or scan more ports                                     |
| Script shows no ports         | Blank output when running the script                     | Target doesn‚Äôt have any closed ports on 22, 80, or 443                 | Remove `grep "closed"` to view all results or try scanning more ports                   |
| Using `cut` on scan result    | Output looks messy or includes unrelated lines           | `cut` is running on the full `nmap` output, including header lines     | Pipe through `grep` first to narrow down to the lines you want                          |
| Using `awk` on scan result    | Unwanted lines like `Starting`, `Nmap`, etc. appear      | `awk` is acting on the entire scan output                             | Filter the output first with `grep` or similar before using `awk`                       |
| Running `whois`               | `command not found`                                      | `whois` isn‚Äôt installed by default                                     | Install it using `sudo apt install whois`                                                |
| `whois` is slow or unresponsive | Takes ages or gives nothing                             | DNS issue or offline machine                                          | Test your internet with `ping 1.1.1.1` or switch to a stable network                    |
| Running `netstat`             | `Command not found`                                      | `netstat` comes with `net-tools` which might not be installed          | Install with `sudo apt install net-tools`                                               |
| `netstat` shows no ports      | Output only shows headings, no services                  | No services are actually listening on the system                       | Start something like `python3 -m http.server` before running `netstat`                 |
| Script returns nothing useful | No ports shown or unexpected results                     | The scanned host is up, but the specified ports are all filtered       | Try scanning more ports or using `-p-` to scan all 65535 ports                         |
| Script doesn‚Äôt work on other systems | Works on Ubuntu but not on others                   | Tools like `nmap` or `whois` aren‚Äôt installed by default everywhere    | Check what‚Äôs installed with `which`, and install any missing tools                     |
| Scanner behaves differently   | Closed ports showing as filtered or open                 | Firewall or host config is blocking or spoofing responses              | Test locally first (`localhost`), and understand that scan behaviour varies by host     |
