# 📖 List of Commands used in Module 3: Variables, Loops, and Conditionals: Building Logic for Defense

## Shebang 🐚🚀

Explanation: A shebang `#!` tells the system which interpreter to use to run a script. By writing `#!/bin/bash`, you're telling the system to use the Bash shell (the location is '/bin/bash') to interpret and execute the script's commands. It's the first line in many shell scripts and ensures the correct program runs the script. We use it for this course because it is a Bash course after all.

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello!"
```
The example tells the system to interpret the script using the Bash shell. This means the next command, `echo "Hello!"` will be ran using the Bash shell. You write this as the first thing you write when writing a script that you want to be ran with the Bash shell.
