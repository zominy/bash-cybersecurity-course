# Error Table for Module 3 💥

| 🧩 Area                         | ⚠️ Error Message / Behaviour                             | ❓ Cause                                                                | ✅ Fix                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Using variables               | Output shows literal like `$USERNAME`                    | Forgot to add the `$` when using the variable                         | Always use a dollar sign when printing or referencing a variable                        |
| Using variables               | Output is blank                                           | Variable wasn’t assigned properly or the command gave nothing         | Make sure the variable is defined and assigned before trying to use it                  |
| `if` condition logic          | Always prints one branch, even when it shouldn’t         | Variable doesn’t match as expected or user isn’t root                 | Use `whoami` to check your actual user before testing the `if` block                    |
| `if` condition syntax         | `[: missing ']'` or `unexpected token`                   | Missing spacing around brackets or incomplete block                   | Format it like `[ "$USER" = "root" ]` and don’t forget to end with `fi`                 |
| `fi` error                    | `fi: command not found` or script exits too early         | Forgot to close the `if` block or spelt `fi` wrong                    | Double check that `fi` is on its own line and spelt correctly                           |
| Loop doesn’t run properly     | Nothing happens or unexpected output                     | You might’ve missed `do`, or used the wrong loop variable             | Make sure your loop looks like `for x in 1 2 3; do`, and your `echo` matches the var     |
| Loop crashes or breaks early  | Syntax error or `do: command not found`                  | Missed the semicolon before `do`, or typo in the loop structure       | If it’s all on one line, you need a semicolon: `for x in ...; do`                       |
| Wrong loop variable used      | Prints things like `Number: $x` instead of real values    | You’re using the wrong variable inside the loop                       | Match your `echo` to the variable declared in the `for` loop                            |
| Using `grep` on logs          | No output appears                                         | There’s no `error` in the files you're scanning                       | That’s fine — you can add a fake one with `echo "error example" >> /var/log/test.log`   |
| Loop scanning logs            | Nothing prints, even though it should                    | The wildcard didn’t match any real files                              | Use `touch /var/log/test.log` to make a test log file                                   |
| Using `find`                 | Loads of `Permission denied` messages                     | You’re trying to access restricted folders like `/root`               | Add `2>/dev/null` to hide errors, or run with `sudo` if needed                          |
| Script output looks messy     | Extra blank lines or strange spacing                     | `echo` used oddly or spacing is inconsistent                          | Clean up your `echo` statements and keep spacing tidy                                   |
| Infinite loop or crash        | Script locks up or won’t stop                            | Logic error or copy paste issue with `while true`, etc.               | Add a break condition or use `Ctrl+C` to stop the script                                |
| Script runs too quickly       | Can’t read what’s happening                              | There are no pauses in your script                                    | Add `sleep 1` or similar to slow it down and make it easier to follow                   |
| Script behaves oddly when run with `sh` | Unexpected errors or ignored logic         | `sh` doesn’t support full Bash features                              | Run with `./script.sh` or `bash script.sh` instead of `sh script.sh`                   |
