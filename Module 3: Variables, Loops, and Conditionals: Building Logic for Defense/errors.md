## 💥 Error Table for Module 3

I think this format is better from now on.

| 🧩 Area                    | ⚠️ Error Message / Behavior                              | ❓ Cause                                                                 | ✅ Fix                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Script doesn’t run        | `Permission denied`                                       | File is not executable                                                 | Run `chmod +x script.sh` or `chmod 700 script.sh` to give execute permission                                      |
| Wrong shell used          | `command not found` or script runs weirdly                | Missing or wrong shebang, or script run with wrong interpreter         | Ensure first line is `#!/bin/bash`, and run with `./script.sh` not `sh script.sh`       |
| Typing script name wrong  | `No such file or directory`                               | Misspelled script name when trying to run it                           | Use `ls` to check the filename, then type it exactly. Use `Tab` to autocomplete         |
| Script runs, does nothing | Blank output                                              | Forgot to save the file or didn’t write any `echo` or commands         | Check inside the file with `nano script.sh`. Save with `Ctrl+O`, Enter, then exit `Ctrl+X`     |
| Incorrect variable usage  | Shows nothing or `$USERNAME` in output                    | Forgot `$` when printing variable or variable not set properly         | Always use `$VARIABLE` to print. Double-check it was defined earlier                    |
| `command not found`       | e.g., `ech "Hi"` instead of `echo`                        | Typo in command                                                        | Double-check spelling. Commands must be exact (`echo`, not `ech`)                       |
| `whoami: command not found`| `USERNAME=$(whoami)` fails                               | Very rare, `whoami` not installed (some minimal VMs)                   | Try `id -un` instead or install coreutils if missing                                    |
| `date +%F` fails          | `date: invalid option`                                    | BusyBox shell used instead of GNU coreutils (rare on full distros)     | Use `date` alone or switch VM to Ubuntu/Debian-based distro                             |
| Script prints incorrect info | Like "Your name is , The date is"                      | Variables undefined or empty                                           | Make sure variables are assigned before `echo`, and commands return values              |
| `if` condition always false | Always prints "You are not the admin"                   | `$USERNAME` doesn't match `"root"` due to user not running with sudo   | Use `sudo ./s1.sh` to run as root, or compare `$(whoami)` manually in terminal          |
| Syntax error in if        | `[: missing ']'` or `unexpected token`                   | Missing spacing around brackets or missing `fi`                        | Always space: `[ "$USER" = "root" ]`, and remember to close `if` with `fi`              |
| `fi: command not found`   | Script exits early                                        | Misspelled `fi` or didn’t end `if` block                               | Check that `fi` exists and is spelled correctly at the end of the `if` block            |
| `do: command not found`   | Loop fails                                                | Missed semicolon `;` or `do` keyword                                   | Must write: `for x in 1 2 3; do` — semicolon is required unless on new line             |
| For loop prints wrong     | `Number: $x` instead of value                             | Wrong variable used (e.g., `$x` instead of `$int`)                     | Use the correct loop variable in `echo`, match name from `for int in ...`               |
| Loop does nothing         | Wildcard didn’t match any files                           | `/var/log/*.log` doesn't exist or is empty in the VM                   | Use `touch /var/log/test.log` to create a dummy log, or test with another directory     |
| `grep` shows nothing      | No output from log scanning                               | No file contains the word `error`                                      | That's OK — add `echo "error example" >> /var/log/test.log` to create test case         |
| `find` throws permission errors | `Permission denied` lines appear                     | Trying to read protected dirs like `/root`                             | Add `2>/dev/null` to suppress errors, or run script as `sudo`                           |
| `./script.sh: command not found` | Wrong shebang, bad encoding                        | Script written with Windows line endings or wrong shell                | Convert using `dos2unix script.sh` and ensure `#!/bin/bash` is used                     |
| Infinite loop or crash    | Not common here, but possible with `while true` or misuse | Bad copy-paste or logic error                                          | Always test your script with small changes. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop stuck script         |
| Script shows extra whitespace | Awkward output formatting                              | Misuse of `echo ""` or not using `\n` properly                         | Clean up with consistent line spacing and indentation                                   |
| Running script in wrong directory | Can't find files like `/var/log/*.log`            | You're not in the expected environment                                 | Ensure you are running this inside a real Linux VM or container with `/var/log` if you are not in the home directory it won't work.         |
| Script runs too fast      | Can’t read what happened                                  | No pauses between steps                                                | Use `sleep` commands to slow it down and make it more interactive                       |
